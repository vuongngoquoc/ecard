              this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our commitment to 
              privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and 
              dissemination practices for our Site<br>

                  <p>Membership Information</p>
                  <footer>Information that 
              allows {'cf_site_title'} to fulfill your request. Generally, the 
              Operators will not share any personal information submitted by you 
              without posting a notification that the Operators intend to do so. 
              With your permission, the Operators may share information 
              submitted by you with the Site's business partners that provide 
              promotional material or help to publish our Web site, maintain our 
              database and/or fulfill orders you have made. You may opt out of 
              receiving materials from such sources at any time requesting to do 
              so at <b><a href="mailto:{'cf_webmaster_email'}" class="Menu_Link">{'cf_webmaster_email'}</a></b>

              <footer>Registration. You 
              will be required to register to take advantage of some of the 
              interactive activities on the Site . To register, you will need to 
              submit your full name and e-mail address and to select a unique 
              member name to be used as an identifier for the feature, and a 
              password.</footer>
              <footer>Either you or the Operators may terminate your membership at any 
              time, for any reason, effective upon sending written notice to the 
              other party. The Operators reserve the right to immediately 
              suspend or terminate your access to the eCard service, without any 
              prior notice, upon any breach of this Agreement by you which is 
              brought to the Operators attention.</footer>
              <footer>In the course of using our site, we automatically track certain 
              information such as your IP addresses and e-mail addresses. Many 
              sites automatically collect this information. If you choose to 
              post messages in our message areas (such as e-cards), we will only 
              display such information about you as you choose to reveal.</footer>
              <footer>If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails, e-cards or 
              letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence 
              about your activities or postings on the site, we may collect such 
              information into a file which is only accessed by authorized 
              personnel. We may also collect other user's comments about you in 
              our complaints department.</footer>

                  <p>Opting Out; Reviewing and Changing Your Information </p>
              <footer>Opting Out. When you sign up for any feature on the Site, you may 
              choose to opt out of (a) receiving communications from the Site or 
              about new features or services, and (b) receiving communications 
              from third-party companies concerning their products or services.

              any time and for any reason, you may notify that preference by

                  <p>Security Policies</p>
                  <footer>Please keep in mind that whatever you publicly disclose online - 
              for example in an e-card, or through e-mail - can be collected and 
              used by others or unlawfully intercepted by third parties. No data 
              transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% 
              secure. While we strive to protect your personal information, the 
              Operators cannot warrant the security of any information you 
              transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. In addition, the 
              Operators may disclose information to law enforcement or other 
              government officials if we determine such disclosure to be 
              necessary or appropriate, or if we are compelled to disclose it by 
              court order or operation of law.</footer>
              <footer>Your {'cf_site_title'} membership registration account is password 
              protected so that only you can access it and view the member 
              information relevant to your account. We recommend that you do not 
              divulge your password to anyone. Ultimately, you are solely 
              responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or 
              account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever 
              you are online.</footer>

                  <p>Use of Cookies</p>
                  <footer>Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to a 
              user's computer hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies 
              make Web-surfing easier for you by saving your preferences while 
              you are at our site. We never save passwords or credit card 
              information in cookies. Accepting a cookie does not give anyone 
              access to your computer or to any personal information. It is 
              simply a small file in which we keep information that identifies 
              you as a unique user. For example, we may use a cookie to indicate 
              when you have already voted for a particular site to prevent 
              multiple voting and a distortion of results.</footer>
                  <footer>The use of cookies is an industry standard - you'll find them at 
              most major Web sites. Most browsers are initially configured to 
              accept cookies. However, you can reset your browser to refuse all 
              cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. Although you will 
              still be able to enjoy many of the features on the Site if you 
              disable your browser from accepting cookies, some parts of the 
              Site's service will not function properly or may be considerably 
              slower if you refuse cookies.</footer>
                  <footer>About IP Addresses and Surveys Used for Research Purposes</footer>
                  <footer>An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your 
              computer whenever you are surfing the Web. Web servers - the 
              computers that &quot;serve up&quot; Web pages - automatically identify your 
              computer by its IP address. When users request pages on the site, 
              our servers log their IP addresses. Some activities within the 
              Site, such as posting a chat message, may display IP addresses 
              along with the user's first name and message. Please review each 
              activity prior to use and only participate in those that involve 
              the disclosure of information you are comfortable with sharing.</footer>

                  <p>Links from {'cf_site_title'} to Other Web Sites</p>
                  <footer>The Operators Privacy Policy addresses only the use and disclosure 
              of information we collect from you on the Site. You may 
              occasionally get cookies from businesses that advertise on the 
              site which the Operators do not control and when you link to the 
              Web sites of third party advertisers, for example through an 
              advertising banner, your use of those sites will be subject to the 
              privacy policies of such third parties, which may differ from the 
              Operators' Privacy Policy.</footer>

              use of personal information by the Operators as outlined in this

              Operators disclose that information. Since this policy may change 
              from time to time, you should check back periodically. Your 
              continued use the Site following the posting of changes to these 
              terms will mean you accept those changes.</footer>
